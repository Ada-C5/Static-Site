            <h2>Rock Climbing</h2>
            <p>I started rock climbing in college at the University of Delaware many moons ago. Since then I have learned sport and trad climbing, worked as a rock climbing trip leader, and climbed outdoors all over the country.  Climbing has been a great way to stay in shape, keep social, take great outdoor trips, and constantly challenge myself.  It can as much of a mental activity as a physical one sometimes and I love it.</p>

        <h3>Music/Crafting....I built this bass guitar.</h3>
        <p>There was a guitar building club at the high school I worked at in Brooklyn, so I was able to build this beauty and make it slightly smaller than a regular bass.  I designed the shape, was able to customize my pickups, and get really good at sanding and oiling. About half the hours I spent working on this were just sanding it to get it juuuuuust right.</p>
