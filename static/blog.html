            <h2> Quote of the Day: Metz on Design </h2>
            <q> Design is more the art of preserving changeability than it is the act of achieving perfection.</q>
            <p> Sandi Metz discussing software design in Practical Object-Oriented Ruby Design.</p>
While reading Sandi Metz’s book on Ruby design I came across this quote in Chapter 2 and it has given me a new perspective on what my priorities are. I find I’m very often questioning myself about how potential changes in requirements will affect my design.</p>

            <h2> Koans about Regexp </h2>
            <p>Today I did the Koans about Beginning the Search. I was curious to see why we had stopped at 2/3 of finishing the koans and how complicated could it be? I found the searching in arrays to not be beyond what we have learned so far.</p>
            <p>I then continued to do the Koans about Regular Expressions. I was surprised to see that there existed a Regexp class. I found the Koans to be a great way to further understand how to use regex for matching patters with all kinds of options.</p>
