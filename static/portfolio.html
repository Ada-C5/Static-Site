    <h3>Word Guess Game Project</h3>
    <p>For this project, I created a game which will allow the user to guess a word letter by letter.  ASCII-art was used as feedback on their guesses  The user should be able to input a single letter at a time.
    Between each guess, the board was redrawn to the terminal output.  Pure Ruby was used for this project.  It runs on terminal.</p>

    <h3>Farmer Market Project</h3>
    <p>For this project, I created an application to look up farmers markets and their related vendors, products, and sales. CSV files were used as the database.   The implementation had class methods to handle finding, sorting, and collecting the data into instances representing individual rows of data. Each of the instances have instance methods to provide details about the object.</p>
