			<p>Currently a student at Ada Developer's Academy, in past manifestations Rowan has been a DJ, a bartender, an executive assistant, and a bookseller. She's currently tackling learning a whole stack of new technologies (see, that's a pun, and she nods at her own cleverness) and writing in the third person.</p>

			<p>In addtition to technological pursuits, Rowan designs tabletop and Live Action Roleplaying Games, as well as speaking at conferences for designers about the importance of inclusivity, respect, and consent as design principles. As an educator, Rowan believes she can achieve her goal of melding the worlds of design and creation to achieve works that have our core principles as people baked in from the start.</p>
