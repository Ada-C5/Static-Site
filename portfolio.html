      <h3>Word Guess</h3>
      <p>This goal of this project was to build a word guessing game like hangman,
        using ASCII art.We had to design the game so the user could input a single
        letter at a time, and the user had a defined number of guesses before losing the game.
        If the guess was correct, the game would show a letter in the word display or
        if the guess was incorrect, reveal a part of the ASCII art. A player wins by guessing
        the word correctly, or loses by exhausting the alottment of guesses which reveals
        all the ASCII art.
        <h4>Here's a sample of code for the ASCII art (we made bunnies!)</h4>
          <samp>
            require 'colorize'<br>
            bunny_one =   "\n========".colorize(:yellow)<br>
            bunny_two =   "\n  ()_() "<br>
            bunny_thr =   "\n  (^+^) "<br>
            bunny_for =   "\n*(')_(')"<br>
            bunny_fiv =   "\n========".colorize(:yellow)<br>
          </samp>
        <h4>Personal Learning Milestones</h4>
        In addition to being the first program I ever wrote, it was also my first pair programming project,
        as well as my first experience with github.</p>

    <h3>Bank Accounts</h3>
    <p>This goal of this project was to build a module with multiple classes, class methods, inheritance
      as well as functionality to read csv files. The goal of the project was to be able to query through any
      means (or account) and get the information needed ie owner(s), balance(s), account id(s), etc...
      <h4>Here's a sample of code for Bank Accounts</h4>
        <samp>
          def self.all(filename = "./support/accounts.csv")<br>
            all_accounts = []<br>
            CSV.open(filename, 'r') do |csv|<br>
              csv.read.each do |line|<br>
              all_accounts << self.new(id: line[0], initial_balance: line[1].to_f/100, start_date: line[2])<br>
              end<br>
            end<br>
            return all_accounts<br>
          end<br>
        </samp>
      <h4>Personal Learning Milestones</h4>
      This project introduced me to multi-document projects, self methods and refactoring process (which I am still working on!).</p>

      <h3>FarMar</h3>
      <p>This goal of this project was to build a module with multiple classes, class methods,
      as well as functionality to read csv files. We got practice writing specs and using TDD, we were
      working with raw data and using it to create instances of a Ruby class, and using Enumerable methods
      to work with collections of data or instances.A user should be able to be able to query through any
      means (or market, owner, product) and get the information needed ie owner(s), market(s), id(s), etc...
        <h4>Here's a sample of code for FarMar</h4>
        <samp>

        </samp>
      <h4>Personal Learning Milestones</h4>
      This project introduced me to TDD and Enumerables-both are challenging but
      I enjoyed working on this project as it seemed straightforward and very useful.</p>
