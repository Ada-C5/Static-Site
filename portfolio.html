      <td>This goal of this project was to build a word guessing game,using ASCII art.
        We had to design the game so the user could input a single
        letter at a time, and the user had a defined number of guesses before losing the game.
        If the guess was correct, the game would show a letter in the word display or
        if the guess was incorrect, reveal a part of the ASCII art. A player wins by guessing
        the word correctly, or loses by exhausting the alottment of guesses which reveals
        all the ASCII art.
