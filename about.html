          <img src="./images/jade_vance_rectangle.jpg" alt="watercolor painting of jade vance by angela coppola" height="25%" width="25%">Human-shaped woman with a head full of puns. Likes coffee, her husband, alcohol, gardening and animals. Dislikes clutter and the smell of formic acid. When not working she can be found travelling the world, napping in sunny spots with her fur children or having David Bowie dance parties with her small human. 
          <br><br>
          Jade is new to the programming party but very much enjoys this new world of analytical creativity.She's learning Ruby right now at Ada Developers Academy while also dipping her toes into CSS/HTML. She's got about eleventy more languages to learn before she will be inflicted upon the world at large. 
          <br><br>
          In a previous life, Jade worked in science for about ten years. She did things like analyze blood for infectious diseases, build tests to screen for diseases and once hacked* into the alarm system on new year's day because the alarm wires were corroded and the alarm was going off for several hours nonstop.

          *By hack I mean exploited the ridiculous vulnerabilities of Windows XP. But the relief felt in the laboratory made me feel like I hacked the gibson.
