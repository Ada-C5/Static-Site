        <p>A few months ago, I applied to <a href="http://adadevelopersacademy.org/" target="_blank">Ada Developers Academy</a>. It's an intense coding school for women that involves 7 months in the classroom learning how to code and making cool projects, and then 5 months at an internship with a tech company in or around Seattle. As you may have guessed, I was accepted!</p>
        <p>So in February, I started learning to code with 23 other women, and it has been well, intense. And rewarding. I go to bed every night exhausted and often don't sleep very well, but I also wake up excited to go back and learn more.</p>
        <p>It's hard for me to even describe how grateful I am for this opportunity. I've spent the majority of my career in research administration and compliance working with the software we used, either working with developers to help create the application, or testing a new version of a program so we could migrate an institution to a new version. I tried to get away from software because I thought it wasn't what I had set out to do as a career.</p>
        <p>But I always came back to the software, and I realized that the thing I enjoyed and was passionate about learning was staring me right in the face.</p>
        <p>After taking online coding courses, it was so much fun that I decided it would be more than worth it to change careers and be a software developer. To focus more on one programming language and get to know others who were learning how to code, I stepped outside my comfort zone. Like, a lot. I took some classes with <a href="https://www.girldevelopit.com/" target="_blank">Girl Develop It!</a> in Ruby and Rails.</p>
        <p>After applying to Ada the second time (yep, I applied more than once!), I was accepted. And here I am, learning to code and building websites!</p>
