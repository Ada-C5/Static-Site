        <h2>My family</h2>
        <p>I met my wife Claire almost eleven years ago in Seattle playing Ultimate Frisbee.  We moved to New York while she attended graduate school at NYU for Physical Therapy, and then we moved back to Seattle to have our son Ryan in 2014.  I am part of a gigantic extended family, with over 50 first cousins, and 30 aunts and uncles.  My parents went the other way and just had me and my brother Devin.  Claire and Ryan and I live in Bryant with our dog Baker.</p>

        <p>I am currently a full-time student at Ada Developers Academy in Seattle, Washinton learning full-stack web development. In my school this year I will work with Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS.  Then I will be placed in an internship where I will maybe learn some more languages.  However, I will be well equipped to handle all the micro-aggressions, sexism and homophobia due to our extensive experience talking about feelings on a daily basis.</p>

          <h2>My dog Baker</h2>
          <p>Claire and I rescued Baker from a shelter in upstate New York in 2009.  She was about a year old. She is a super smart dog who can open doors and get into everything.  She is a super mutt, and one time while walking around Brooklyn someone screamed "that dog is SEXY!" We drag her everywhere, including rock climbing and hiking. She puts up with us most of the time.</p>
