  <h2>Solo Projects</h2>

  <article class="solar-system"><h3>Solar System</h3>
    <p>Solar System was our first project working with Ruby classes, inheritance and writing methods. This simple little terminal program gives the user information about a planet in the Solar System based on their choice. For me, this was the first time I felt like I truly understood classes and how to use them.</p>

    <p>I'm, like, overly proud of the user experience stuff I added to this project. It made it really fun to work on.</p>

  <article class="bank-accounts"><h3>Bank Accounts</h3>
    <p>Bank Accounts was another Ruby project working with classes, but this time we were importing data from csv files. This project really helped me solidify writing methods (because we had to write a LOT of them!).</p>

  <article class="FarMar"><h3>FarMar</h3>
    <p>FarMar (an abbreviation for Farmer's Market) was our first solo Ruby project working with spec testing. Having worked on a pair project that used spec testing, I didn't feel like I <em>quite</em> had the hang of it. This project really solidified testing for me.</p>

    <p>The project itself contains many different Ruby classes and methods, as well as many different CSV files of data. Understanding how each of these files were talking to each other was the goal of this project, and I feel like I really got it.</p>

    <p>I also had a breakthrough on removing redundancy in my code, and spent an important work day revising and restructuring. I think my end result was better for it.</p>

  <article class="static-site"><h3>Static Site</h3>
    <p>Static Site was my first foray into HTML and CSS and...you're on it right now! I had some confusion with implicit padding and margins, which I'm still a bit perplexed by, but I imagine that the more I do this the sooner understanding will come!</p>

  <h2>Pair Programming Projects</h2>

  <article class="word-guess"><h3>Word Guess</h3>
    <p>Word Guess was our first project done in pair programming. Written in Ruby, we made a "hangman style" word guessing game, where a user would guess letters and the program would give them progress on how they were doing--via ASCII art!</p>

    <p>This project was challenging, because it was done so early in my Ruby educational journey, but ultimately I'm pleased with what we were able to do--even with our limited knowledge.</p>

  <article class="Scrabble"><h3>Scrabble</h3>
    <p>Scrabble was our second pair project, but our first proejct working with spec testing. This week-long project was a challenge, as I only had a basic grasp of testing. But in the end, there are some sections of our code that I'm pleased with.</p>
