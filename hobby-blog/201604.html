		<p>I've been a historical costumer and cosplayer for most of my life. I made my first costume when I was in the third grade and I never really looked back. Though in the beginning my costume making mostly consisted of childhood "creativity" with bedsheets, vast new worlds opened up when I learned to sew.</p>

		<p>The collage above is a step by step walk through in images of making stays and a skirt. This is from a project I started last summer called the "poison apple dress"...so named because the fabric for it is an acid green silk taffeta that made me think of poison apples.</p>
