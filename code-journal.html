            <td>I had some trouble getting started until I identified what was needed in the end. The distance is the sum of   differences between strands. I began to think about how to compare the 2 strands (arrays) of nucleotides after verifying that they were comparable. Thought about doing an index_each but that failed. Tried printing results and wasn’t the answer. I used zip in another exercise so tried that here though I had the syntax wrong a couple of times. Printing things out along the way helped to see what the array methods were yielding. Ultimately zip method for arrays what I went with.</td>

              **inspect is a method that, by default, tells you the class name, the instance's object_id, and lists off the instance's instance variables.</td>
