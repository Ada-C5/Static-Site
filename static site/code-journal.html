        <h3>This Was A Nice Break</h3>
        </section>
        <li><textarea rows=”10″ cols=”100″>This was a much needed week off. I can not even express my gratitude for the time off. I was able to catch up on sleep and on understanding some of the things learned in Ruby. Like I really was able to sit back and go, yes, that makes sense and of course I see why that is.
          I was told this would become more familiar and it is!!!
          I know that the rest is up to me, I need to continue to be diligent and study. I need to take the time that I have to be a learner and continue to learn an get comfortable with learning and working hard.
          I think that I take time to understand and grasp concepts, but it doesn’t mean I do not get it. I really do get it. I am so happy I chose to attend Ada and that I am able to get the skills I came here for.
          I look forward to what is ahead because I know that I will get it and I will be really good at them. I know that computer languages and development is meant for me. I just needed some time to get it into my system.
          Looking forward to solidifying what I am learning. GO RUBY!!.</textarea></li>

      <h3>First Month Down</h3>
      </section>
      <li><textarea rows=”10″ cols=”100″>Yes! I have completed my first month as a C5 student. I had so much fear, anger and "finally lets just get it over" feelings. I have worked very hard to get to this point. It has been three months of waiting and during that time the question, “should I be here” has come up a lot for me. The answer is YES!
        What I have come to understand is that carrying the above mentioned feelings, be it valid and okay, are not serving me as I continue my journey through Ada. Why? These feelings ultimately get in the way of the most important goal, learning. When I operate out my feelings, I have found that learning is second. When I want to be mad, I don’t participate, ask questions, and actively engage. All of these behaviors are important for learning and taking in new information.
        My word for 2016 is ACCEPTANCE. I will and need to accept that I am no longer in C4. I am now C5 and it is a great opportunity for my life that I will never get again.
        I am a software developer and I have had more time to develop my skills, yay! I can now see the fruits of my labor as just this week, March 20’s…I was able to explain to my tutors, yes I have several what I was doing or at least trying to do. I am understanding Ruby. I am so happy our relationship is no longer on the rocks and is improving as I knew we would need to mend the past in order to move into the present.
        I have goals, but the most important is to see myself as a developer who has the ability to learn languages and enjoy the process. This is one turn in my career that I know will be fun and rewarding both intellectually and financially.</textarea></li>

      <h3>Thoughts Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby</h3>
      </section>
      <li><textarea>- We want to do our best work, and we want the work we do to have meaning. And all else being equal we prefer to enjoy ourselves along the way.
        - Frustration with programming is when it cost to much to get things done.
        - It is up to you to question, to experiment, and to chose.
        - Design, is thus an art, the art of arranging code.
        - Do the best you can in the time you have
        - Object oriented applications are made up of objects and the messages that pass between them.
        - A class defines methods(definitions of behavior) and attributes(definitions of variables)
        - Once you have an object like string….they all behave like strings. They have different data, but they respond to different messages
        Thoughts:
        software will always be a reflection of the people who wrote it
        this can be an art more then a science
        learning whats the objet and what is the message</textarea></li>
