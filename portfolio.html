        <p>This game was built using Ruby. The game functions similarly to the classic game Hangman minus all the morbidity. I used ASCII art to provide a visual representation of remaining guesses to the user. Check out my code <a href="https://github.com/abrown152/Word-Guess">here!</a></p>

        <p>This bank account program was built using Ruby. This was the first time I successfully linked a program to a CSV! This project allowed me to explore object-oriented programming on a deeper level covering concepts including inheritance, modules, and error handling.Check out my code <a href="https://github.com/abrown152/BankAccounts">here!</a></p>

        <p>This program was built using Ruby. This project allowed me to utilize databases, Enumerable, and test-driven development for the first time. Due to the larger scope of this project compared to my previous work, I was also able to practice organization and clarity within my code.
