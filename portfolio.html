			<h1>Ruby</h1>

			<p>At Ada Academy, the first language we start learning is Ruby. The first six weeks is pretty intense "get up to speed" with fundamentals of computer science (how to think like a dev) and language specifics.</p>

			<p>Ruby projects I've done include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><img src="images/solar-system.jpg" alt="a screenshot of Solar System" width="178"><h2><a href="https://github.com/cotarg/Solar-System">Solar System</a></h2> a Ruby project to learn how classes work.</li>

				<li><img src="images/word-guess.jpg" alt="A screenshot of Word Guess" width="181"><a href="https://github.com/cotarg/Word-Guess"><h2>Word Guess</h2></a> a project I completed with Ania G. to make a Hangman style word guess game. Our theme was Pac-man.</li>

				<li><img src="images/bank-account.jpg" alt="screenshot of Bank Accounts" width="104"><a href="https://github.com/cotarg/BankAccounts"><h2>Bank Accounts</h2></a> a project handling input from CSVs and learning about objects.</li>

				<li><img src="images/scrabble.jpg" alt="a screenshot of Scrabble" width="182"><a href="https://github.com/annamw77/Scrabble"><h2>Scrabble</h2></a> a project I did with Anna to create a Scrabble Letter Tile Bag and Player class. The fundamentals of a scrabble game.</li>
			</ul>

		<section class="webpages">
			<h1>HTML/CSS</h1>
			<p>This web page that you're currently looking at is a class project in learning to write and style webpages by hand. It was entirely coded in Sublime Text 3, and handstyled using only CSS. One of the most interesting challenges of this project was learning how to conceive of and structure the various containers on the page using only HTML for structure and doing all styles through CSS.</p>

			<h1>Talks and Presentations</h1>
			<h2>Lightning Talk - Purim:</h2>
			<p>One of the things we've worked on at Ada is our ability to give talks. To practice, our class did lightning talks, and I spoke about Purim (a Jewish holiday). You can <a href="resources/purm.pptx">check out my slides</a> if you like.</p>
